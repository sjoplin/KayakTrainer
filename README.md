# Whitewater Kayaking Training Project

## Main Collaborators

* Bojun Yang
* Sean Joplin


## Overview 
This project is aimed at teaching the basics of white water kayaking. It does this by having tutorials and guidance for practice on a flat water lake.

## Motivation
White water kayaking is an inherently dangerous sport, especially so for those without practice. Practice usually takes place on flatwater such as a lake or pool, but there may not be great access to these facilities. It is also an expensive sport, with the total gear costing upwards of $2000. By making the sport more accessible, we hope to allow more people to enjoy the great outdoors.
 
# Development Environment

This project is written in typescript using the Babylon.js engine.

To work with this sample, you should have Node (and in particular, npm and npx) installed, which you can retrieve from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).   

In addition to node, you should make sure a recent (e.g., version 3.9 or later) version of Typescript is installed, as described at [www.typescriptlang.org](http://www.typescriptlang.org).

Finally, we will use the node `npx` command to both build the project (with webpack) and run a local http webserver on your machine.  The ```package.json``` is set up to run this server 

## Running 

You set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from npm with 
```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:
```
npm run start
```
